pre-made template for running pen-tests using Evil Twin

i do use it in different tests with different devices, so it's just my personal storage for code

i use [this-is-bruce](https://github.com/pr3y/Bruce) as the soft for M5Stack StickC Plus2 to run Evil Twin for pen-tests



> [!NOTE]
> At the moment i have only tested on M5Stack StickC Plus2 hardware.



- [ ] i will add more templates
- [ ] more different colors in a bash script



> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is only a .html template for Evil Twin, this is not the tool to run it in general.


> [!CAUTION]
> This tool is ment for speeding pen-testing process, don't be a skid, don't attack things you don't own.
